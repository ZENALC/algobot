"""
A super simple example of a strategy with Bollinger bands and moving averages.

Note that Algobot will NOT display this strategy as its name is "Sample." If you want to experiment with this strategy,
rename it to something other than "Sample".

This is a complete strategy that supports lower interval notifications, logging, backtest, optimizations, simulations,
and live trading. Not recommended to actually live trade with this strategy.

*** THE STRATEGY ***

    If the opening price is less than the lower band, then our trend is BULLISH. If the opening price is
    higher than the upper band, then our is trend is BEARISH.

    Next, we are leveraging moving averages too, so for that, if the 1st moving average is higher than the second one,
    we are bullish, and vice-versa.

    Note that both of the above have to have the same trend for the bot to enter a position.

    If Bollinger bands are bearish, but moving averages are bullish, no action is taken.
    If Bollinger bands are bullish, but moving averages are bearish, no action is taken.
    If Bollinger bands are bullish AND moving averages are bullish, bot will enter long.

*** END OF THE STRATEGY ***
